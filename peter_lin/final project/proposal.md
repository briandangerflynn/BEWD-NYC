The website will let visitors text/email/share gifs taken at parties

Will call GIFS/MP4 files from Gryphy and display them in a gallery page

Will use the Gyphy API
https://api.giphy.com/

Will possibly use the Facebook API (currently not sure where the data will be coming from)

Will work with a friend who needs this website (he will be doing the front-end design work)

Will emulate this:
